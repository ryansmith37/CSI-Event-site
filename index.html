   <h1>Why INITIATIVE?</h1>
   <p>India had a national dream before 1947. That dream was to become an independent country, and it came true. But things have become a bit fuzzy since then.Today, if you asked someone on the street what India&#39s national dream is, they wouldn&#39tknow. If you asked a politician, he may talk about it for an hour, but in the endneither he nor you would know. We dont need a report. There was already one released in 2002 by the Planning Commission titled India – Vision 2020”. And we don’t need cute pithy phrases. It&#39s not enough just to be “Incredible India.” Initiative is a vision that promises to take India to the world, and get students and professionals across geographies to compete, collaborate and co-create a better future for all of us.
